  "body": "About TurboVNC\r\n==============\r\n\r\nVirtual Network Computing (VNC) is a remote display system that allows you to\r\nview and interact with a desktop environment that is running on a remote\r\ncomputer.  Using VNC, you can run graphical applications on a remote machine\r\nand send only the pixels generated by those applications to your local machine.\r\nVNC is platform-independent and supports a wide variety of operating systems\r\nand architectures as both servers and clients.\r\n\r\nTurboVNC is a high-speed version of VNC derived from TightVNC.  It contains\r\na variant of Tight encoding that is tuned to maximize performance for image-\r\nintensive applications (such as VirtualGL, video applications, and image\r\neditors) while still providing excellent performance for other types of\r\napplications.  TurboVNC, in combination with VirtualGL, provides a complete\r\nsolution for remotely displaying 3D applications with interactive performance.\r\n\r\nRefer to the TurboVNC User's Guide and man pages for a more thorough\r\ndescription of the components that make up TurboVNC.\r\n\r\n\r\nLegal\r\n=====\r\n\r\nTurboVNC is\r\n\r\n    Copyright (C) 2009-2016 D.
