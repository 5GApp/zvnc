#OPT: noList! plain!

Download the appropriate binary package, as above, then execute the following
commands:

	RPM-based systems :: {:}
	#Verb <<---
	mkdir ~/turbovnc
	cd ~/turbovnc
	rpm2cpio {full path of turbovnc*.rpm} | cpio -idv
	---

	Debian-based systems :: {:}
	#Verb <<---
	dpkg-deb --extract {full path of turbovnc*.deb} ~/turbovnc
	---

Add __~/turbovnc__ to any paths specified in this document.  Note that the
TurboVNC security configuration file will not work when TurboVNC is installed
in this manner.

** Installing the TurboVNC Viewer on macOS

	#. Download the TurboVNC Mac disk image
		(''TurboVNC-''__''{version}''__''.dmg'') from the
		[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/turbovnc/files/][Files area]]
		of the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/turbovnc][TurboVNC SourceForge project page]].

		!!! This package requires [[http://www.java.com][Oracle Java]] or
		[[https://jdk.java.net][OpenJDK]].

	#. Open the disk image, then open ''TurboVNC.pkg'' inside the
		disk image.  Follow the instructions to install the Mac TurboVNC Viewer.

** Installing the TurboVNC Viewer on Windows

	#. Download the TurboVNC Windows installer package
		(''TurboVNC-''__''{version}''__''-x86.exe'' for 32-bit systems or
		''TurboVNC-''__''{version}''__''-x64.exe'' for 64-bit systems) from the
		[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/turbovnc/files/][Files area]]
		of the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/turbovnc][TurboVNC SourceForge project page]].

	#. Run the TurboVNC installer.  The installation of TurboVNC should be
		self-explanatory.  The only configuration option is the directory into
		which you want the files to be installed.

** Installing TurboVNC from Source

If you are using a Linux/Un*x platform for which there is not a pre-built
TurboVNC binary package available, then download the TurboVNC source tarball
(''turbovnc-''__''{version}''__''.tar.gz'') from the
[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/turbovnc/files/][Files area]]
of the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/turbovnc][TurboVNC SourceForge project page]],
uncompress it, ''cd turbovnc-''__''{version}''__, and read ''BUILDING.md''
