# The VNCSERVERS variable is a list of display:user pairs, separated by
# spaces.
#
# Uncomment the first line below to start a TurboVNC session under the account
# 'myusername' (adjust this to your own user name) and listening on Display :1.
# You will also need to configure a VNC password (run
# 'man -M {TurboVNC_directory}/man vncpasswd' for instructions) or another form
# of authentication.  See the TurboVNC User's Guide for more information about
# the authentication methods available in TurboVNC.  If you intend to connect
# to the TurboVNC session over an untrusted network, then it is strongly
# recommended that you configure the session to require TLS or SSH encryption.
# Refer to the TurboVNC User's Guide and the Xvnc man page
# ('man -M {TurboVNC_directory}/man Xvnc') for more information.  Set the
# VNCSERVERARGS[n] variable in order to specify arguments that should be passed
# to vncserver when creating the TurboVNC session for Display :n.  Refer to
# the TurboVNC Server man pages ('man -M {TurboVNC_directory}/man vncserver'
# and 'man -M {TurboVNC_directory}/man Xvnc') for a list of possible arguments.

# VNCSERVERS="1:myusername"
# VNCSERVERARGS[1]=""
