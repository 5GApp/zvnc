Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a remote display system that allows you to view and interact with a desktop environment that is running on a remote computer.  Using VNC, you can run graphical applications on a remote machine and send only the pixels generated by these applications to your local machine.  VNC is platform-independent and supports a wide variety of operating systems and architectures as both servers and clients.

TurboVNC is a high-speed version of VNC derived from TightVNC.  It contains a variant of Tight encoding that is tuned to maximize performance for image-intensive applications (such as VirtualGL, video applications, and image editors) while still providing excellent performance for other types of applications.  TurboVNC, in combination with VirtualGL, provides a complete solution for remotely displaying 3D applications with interactive performance.

This package includes the TurboVNC Viewer, which provides optimal performance when connecting to the TurboVNC Server.  Java 8 or later is required.

Refer to the TurboVNC User's Guide (a link to which is provided in the "TurboVNC" Applications folder) for usage information.
